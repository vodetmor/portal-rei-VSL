- Background color: Deep Dark Purple (#231123) for the main background, creating a dark, immersive, and modern feel.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to ensure readability and a professional look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Mobile-first and fully responsive design.
- Smooth fade-in animations on sections and subtle hover effects (scaling and a shimmer) on buttons and portfolio items.
- Components with a modern look, rounded corners, and subtle shadows.
- The hero section's background should feature an animated, Valorant-style visual effect with sharp, energetic rays or lightning, using the primary Claret color (#C30F45) to create a high-impact first impression.
